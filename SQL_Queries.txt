*SQL Query for table import - change path and title 'Test' as needed

*Experimenting with updates
    Update Raw_Games
    SET esrb_rating = NULL

    UPDATE Raw_Games

*Find how many duplicates per title
    SELECT title, COUNT(title) as count from raw_games
    GROUP BY title
    ORDER BY count desc

*Find all different ESRB Ratings
    SELECT DISTINCT esrb_rating FROM test

*Find popularity categorized by ESRB rating
    SELECT esrb_rating, COUNT(esrb_rating) as count FROM raw_games

    ORDER BY count desc

*Gather distinct titles where the platform score is highest

  *STEP 1 CREATE NEW TABLE SORTED

         "genre" TEXT);
    INSERT INTO test SELECT * FROM raw_games
    ORDER BY user_score DESC, number_of_users DESC /* Multi-level sorting (nice)

  *STEP 2 USE rowid FOR INDEXING THEN DELETE ROWS THAT COME AFTER THE FIRST INSTANCE OF A DUPLICATE YIELDS HIGHEST
  SCORE FOR A TITLE

    DELETE FROM test
    WHERE rowid NOT IN
    (SELECT MIN(rowid) FROM test
    GROUP BY title)

*Give a preview of the data - also top 10 scoring games
    SELECT * FROM test
    LIMIT 10

*Find games with very few ratings #TODO change to delete possibly to reduce inaccuracies
    SELECT * FROM test
    WHERE number_of_users < 50
    ORDER BY number_of_users asc

*Need to reformat dates for date comparisons - Whoops..  #TODO Give date correct type in order to do BETWEEN? also YYYY-MM-DD?
    SELECT title,
    substr(release_date, 7) ||
    substr(release_date, 1, 2) ||
    substr(release_date, 4, 2) as formatted_date,
    release_date FROM Raw_games

*Number of games per platform - #TODO don't equalize. Can draw correlation after duplicate clean
    SELECT platform, count(platform) AS count FROM test
    GROUP BY platform
    ORDER BY count DESC

*Top Developers
    SELECT developer, count(developer) AS count FROM raw_games
    GROUP BY developer
    ORDER BY count DESC

*Count single player and multiplayer games
    SELECT COUNT(player_mode) FILTER (WHERE player_mode = '1 Player' OR player_mode = 'No Online Multiplayer') AS Single_Player,
    COUNT(player_mode) FILTER (WHERE player_mode != '1 Player' OR player_mode != 'No Online Multiplayer' OR player_mode IS NOT NULL) AS Multiplayer
    FROM test

*Find which games critics and users agree on the most
    SELECT *, SQRT(POWER(critic_score - adj_user_score, 2)) as difference FROM (SELECT title, critic_score, user_score * 10 as adj_user_score FROM test)
    ORDER BY difference ASC

*Find which games critics and users disagree on the most
    SELECT *, SQRT(POWER(critic_score - adj_user_score, 2)) as difference FROM (SELECT title, critic_score, user_score * 10 as adj_user_score FROM test)
    ORDER BY difference DESC

*Find which games users rate higher than critics
    SELECT *, SQRT(POWER(critic_score - adj_user_score, 2)) as difference FROM (SELECT title, critic_score, user_score * 10 as adj_user_score FROM test)
    WHERE adj_user_score > critic_score
    ORDER BY difference DESC

*Find which games users rate lower than critics
    SELECT *, SQRT(POWER(critic_score - adj_user_score, 2)) as difference FROM (SELECT title, critic_score, user_score * 10 as adj_user_score FROM test)
    WHERE adj_user_score < critic_score
    ORDER BY difference DESC

*Years ranked by number of games in each year
    SELECT t, count(t) as games_per_year
    FROM (SELECT substr(test.release_date, 7) as t FROM test) /* derived table in FROM clause to pull from first */
    GROUP BY t

*Months ranked by number of games in each month
    SELECT t, count(t) as games_per_month
    FROM (SELECT substr(test.release_date, 1, 2) as t FROM test)
    GROUP BY t

*Filter by platform order by score
    SELECT * FROM test
    WHERE platform = "Switch"
    ORDER BY critic_score DESC

*Find games based on similar titles, or genres
    SELECT * FROM test
    WHERE title LIKE "%Mario%"

*Pitting two genres' average scores against each other (of similar quantities)
    SELECT AVG(shooter.user_score), AVG(rpg.user_score)
    FROM (SELECT * FROM test WHERE genre LIKE "%Shooter%") as shooter,
    (SELECT * FROM test WHERE genre LIKE "%RPG%") as rpg

# TODO address genres with Python, rank developers based on avg of score?
