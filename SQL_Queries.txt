*Creating a back-up

    INSERT INTO backup SELECT * FROM raw_games

*Adding a formatted_date column

*Updating with formatted date values

*Find games between dates with new column

*Find how many duplicates per title
    SELECT title, COUNT(title) as count from raw_games

*Filter out duplicate titles from other platforms with lower scores

  *STEP 1 CREATE NEW TABLE SORTED

  *STEP 3 USE rowid FOR INDEXING THEN DELETE ROWS THAT COME AFTER THE FIRST INSTANCE OF A DUPLICATE YIELDS HIGHEST
  SCORE FOR A TITLE

    DELETE FROM final_games

*Find the average user score for each platform rounded

*Find all different ESRB Ratings
    SELECT DISTINCT esrb_rating FROM final_games

*Find popularity categorized by ESRB rating
    SELECT esrb_rating, COUNT(esrb_rating) as count FROM raw_games

*Give a preview of the data - also top 10 scoring games

*Years ranked by number of games in each year
    SELECT t, count(t) as games_per_year

*Months ranked by number of games in each month
    SELECT t, count(t) as games_per_month
    FROM (SELECT substr(final_games.release_date, 1, 2) as t FROM final_games)
    GROUP BY t

*Filter by platform order by score
    SELECT * FROM final_games
    WHERE platform = "Switch"
    ORDER BY critic_score DESC

*Find games based on similar titles, or genres
    SELECT * FROM final_games
    WHERE title LIKE "%Mario%"

*Pitting two genres' average scores against each other (of similar quantities)
    SELECT AVG(shooter.user_score), AVG(rpg.user_score)
    FROM (SELECT * FROM final_games WHERE genre LIKE "%Shooter%") as shooter,
    (SELECT * FROM final_games WHERE genre LIKE "%RPG%") as rpg

# TODO address genres with Python, rank developers based on avg of score?

# TODO level out critic and user scores instead of 100 and 10 make them equal

# TODO what do these top games have in common? what is popular? why are they successful?

# TODO 'export' tables from sqlitestudio as needed
